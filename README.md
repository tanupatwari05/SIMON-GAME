# Simon Says – Memory Game
A browser-based memory challenge game built using pure JavaScript to demonstrate strong fundamentals in logic building, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

# Why This Project?
This project focuses on core JavaScript concepts rather than libraries or frameworks.
It demonstrates the ability to:

- Build logic-driven applications
- Handle user interactions cleanly
- Manage state across multiple levels
- Write readable, maintainable code

# How the Game Works ?

1. Press any key to start the game
2. The game flashes a random color
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons
4. Each correct round adds one new color
5. A wrong input ends the game
6. Press any key to restart

# Core Logic Overview

- A random color sequence is generated by the system
- User inputs are captured on button clicks
- Inputs are validated step-by-step against the system sequence
- Correct input → next level
- Incorrect input → game reset

# Technologies Used

* HTML5 
* CSS3 
* JavaScript 
- No external libraries or frameworks used.
