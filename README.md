# Simon Says –  JavaScript Memory Game
A browser-based memory challenge game built with **vanilla JavaScript**, designed to strengthen logic building and event-driven programming.

# Why This Project Exists
This project focuses on core JavaScript concepts rather than libraries or frameworks.
It demonstrates the ability to:

- Practice building logic-first applications
- Understand event handling in real scenarios
- Manage game state across levels 
- Improve code redablilty and structure

# Game Flow (Step-by-Step)

1. Press any key to start the game
2. A random color is shown on the screen 
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons
4. Each correct round adds one new color
5. A wrong input ends the game
6. Press any key to restart

# Core Logic Overview

- The system generates a random color sequence
- User actions are recorded through button clicks
- Each input is checked immediately against the game sequence

# Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- No external libraries or frameworks used
- Built to strengthen core frontend fundamentals.
